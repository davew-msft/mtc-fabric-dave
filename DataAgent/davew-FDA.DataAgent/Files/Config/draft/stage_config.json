  "aiInstructions": "These instructions are for the overall data agent and will always be sent regardless of the question asked.\nExplain:\n- Rules for planning how to approach each question\n- Which data sources to use for different topics\n- Any terminology or acronyms with consistent meanings across all connected data sources\n- Tone, style, and formatting for finished responses\n---\n\n* Whenever I ask about \"the most sold\" products or items, the metric of interest is total sales revenue and not order quantity.\n* The primary table to use is FactInternetSales. Only use FactResellerSales if explicitly asked about resales or when asked about total sales.\n* When asked about the impact of promotions, do so on the increase in sales revenue, not just the number of units sold.\n* For customer insights, focus on the total sales amount per customer rather than the number of orders.\n* Use DimDate to extract specific time periods (for example, year, month) when performing time-based analysis.\n* When analyzing geographical data, prioritize total sales revenue and average sales per order for each region.\n* For product category insights, always use DimProductCategory to group products accordingly.\n* When comparing sales between regions, use DimSalesTerritory for accurate territory details.\n* Use DimCurrency to normalize sales data if analyzing sales in different currencies.\n* For detailed product information, always join FactInternetSales with DimProduct.\n* Use DimPromotion to analyze the effectiveness of different promotional campaigns.\n* For reseller performance, focus on total sales amount and not just the number of products sold.\n* When analyzing trends over time, use FactInternetSales and join with DimDate to group data by month, quarter, or year.\n* Always check for data consistency by joining FactInternetSales with the corresponding dimension tables.\n* Use SUM for aggregating sales data to ensure you're capturing total values accurately.\n* Prioritize sales revenue metrics over order quantity, to gauge the financial impact accurately.\n* Always group by relevant dimensions (for example, product, customer, date) to get detailed insights.\n* When asked about customer demographics, join DimCustomer with relevant fact tables.\n* For sales by promotion, join FactInternetSales with DimPromotion and group by promotion name.\n* Normalize sales figures using DimCurrency for comparisons involving different currencies.\n* Use ORDER BY clauses to sort results by the metric of interest (for example, sales revenue, total orders).\n* ListPrice in DimProduct is the suggested selling price, while UnitPrice in FactInternetSales and FactResellerSales is the actual price at which each unit was sold. For most use cases on revenue, the unit price should be used.\n* Rank top resellers by sales amount.\n\n-------------\n\n* An \"active customer' is defined as any customer who purchased something in the past 365 days.
